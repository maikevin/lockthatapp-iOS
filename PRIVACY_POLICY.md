## How Data Is Stored

- **All data is stored locally on your device** using standard iOS storage (UserDefaults)

- We do not have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or billing details
- Subscription management is handled through your Apple ID settings

## Screen Time Permissions

- The app requests access to the Screen Time / Family Controls framework to monitor and manage app usage on your device
- This permission is used solely to enforce the time limits you set
- If you deny this permission, the app will operate in a limited mode without automatic tracking
- You can revoke this permission at any time in Settings → Screen Time

## Notifications

- The app may request permission to send local notifications (usage alerts, breathing reminders, daily summaries, intention timers)
- All notifications are generated locally on your device — no push notification servers are involved

## Data Retention & Deletion

- Usage history is retained locally for up to 1 year, then older records are automatically removed

- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data

## Children's Privacy
